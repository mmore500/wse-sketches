\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

Proposed work lays the foundations to harness wafer-scale computing for agent-based modeling.
Orders-of-magnitude scale-up will bring entirely new classes of cross-scale dynamics within reach across many ABM application areas.
To advance on this front, we explore a fundamental re-frame of simulation that shifts from a paradigm of complete, perfect data observability to dynamic, approximate observability akin to estimation approaches traditionally used to study physical systems.

Within ABM, our proposed work focuses in particular on the topic of evolutionary computation.
We will harness cutting-edge \textit{hereditary stratigraphy} (HStrat) approaches to distributed phylogenetic tracking to investigate fundamental questions about the relationship between phylogenetic structure, population scale, and time scale.
These new HStrat methods, and extensive development targeting the Cerebras CSL using the SDK hardware simulator, position our project to hit the ground running.
Our project design emphasizes concrete steps to demonstrate and evaluate novel algorithms to establish strong technical foundations for follow-on work with distributed agent-based digital evolution.
We are committed to organizing project implementation to produce reusable CSL and Python software tools to catalyze research capabilities among the broader ABM community.

Potential extensions of this work include repurposing HStrat's rolling cross-temporal sampling algorithms to facilitate efficient downsampled observability in additional application domains.
Possibilities include sampling time series activity at simulation sites or extracting coarsened agent histories (e.g., position over time).
Within the domain of evolution modeling, we anticipate building from the work proposed here to conduct cross-scale evo-epidemiological research into how pathogen trait evolution confronts fitness trade-offs related to within-host infection dynamics and between-host transmissibility.
