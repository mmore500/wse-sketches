\section{Conclusion} \ref{sec:conclusion}

Laying the foundations for an entirely new class of simulation on the WSE: PDES/ABMS.
Wafer-scale integration has the potential to have significant impacts on ABMS --- lots of agents to generate multiscale dynamics with low-latency interactions between agents being a key.

Extensive algorithm and methods development targeting massively distributed computational modalities such as the Cerebras WSE.
This has led to ready-made solutions.
The technical infrastructure necessary for the project is largely in place through use of the hardware simulator Cerebras SDK.

We look forward to answering questions around phylogenetic scale, with a primary emphasis on generating general-purpose methodologies and reusable software tools that can catalyze research in this area.
