\section{Preliminary Work} \label{sec:preliminary-work}

In preparation for proposed work, we joined the Cerebras SDK program \citep{selig2022cerebras} and assembled Cerebras Software Language (CSL) software implementations that will be necessary to conduct experiments with WSE hardware.
For the time being, we have used Cerebras' hardware emulator to test our software implementations.
This section reports a small-scale experiment performed to validate the core software functionality.
In addition to this integration test, software quality has also been verified through an associated unit test suite.

In addition to unit and integration tests, we performed a simple experiment to validate reconstructions performed.
In this experiment, we evolved a population of simple genomes with HStrat annotations under drift conditions on the island model GA kernel, exported end-state genomes for postprocessing, and used the HStrat annotations to reconstruct their phylogenetic history.

Simulation ran for 120 PE generation cycles with a population size of 32 per PE, and a tournament size of 5.
For simplicity, drift conditions were imposed --- all genomes were evaluated to a fitness value of 0.0.
Due to performance limitations of the hardware simulator, we performed this experiment using a small 3x3 grid of processor elements.

Genomes were fixed-length 3 word arrays represented using data type \texttt{u32}.
Figure \ref{fig:validation-example:genomes} details the content and layout of genomes, and provides example genome values yielded from simulation.
Notably, the first sixteen bits were used to tag clade geneses.
At the outset of simulation, founding population members were each assigned a randomized tag value.
This value was inherited without mutation over the course of simulation.
Thus, it can be used to identify end-state genomes that evolved from the same original ancestor.

The send buffers were sized to hold one genome and the receive buffers to hold 4 genomes.
Within the simulation window, between 28 and 33 receive cycles completed for each PE and between 112 and 132 send cycles were completed for each PE.

At the end of simulation, one genome was sampled per PE.
Figure \ref{fig:validation-example:phylogeny} shows the result of phylogenetic reconstruction on these sampled genomes.
To simplify visualization of the phylogeny with existing phyloinformatic tools, all clades were stitched together into a single tree by attaching them to a common ancestor.
Taxa are colored according to their clade genesis tag.
Clade arrangement in the reconstructed tree agrees well with founding clade identities.
All different-colored taxa are predicted to have had ancient common ancestry.
Note that relatedness between \texttt{0x5fb} and \texttt{0xde40} is slightly overestimated, due to a configured lack of precise resolution necessary to ensure compact genetic annotations.
Applications where high reconstruction precision is required can opt to use larger annotation sizes.
